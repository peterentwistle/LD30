LD#30 - Theme: Connected Worlds
==========

This is my Ludum Dare #30 entry.

Ok so this is my first submission to Ludum Dare, it is far from what I would consider complete. My main aim for this competition was to learn something new. I have learnt so much about the Phaser framework as well as game development in general. Considering I only started using using Phaser for the competition I think I have done better than I anticipated. Next time I will definitely do a lot more practicing before the competition starts to get comfortable with my chosen environment.
